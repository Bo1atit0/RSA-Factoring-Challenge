# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Description
RSA is a widely used public key cryptosystem that enables secure data transmission and digital signatures
It uses the mathematical properties of large prime numbers for the encryption and decryption of messages
The security of RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers
This project is designed to Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

# Tasks

0. Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Usage: factors <file>
where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
One number per line
You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
The file will always end with a new line
Output format: n=p*q
one factorization per line
p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
See example
You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish
Push all your scripts, source code, etc… to your repository
we will only run your executable factors

1. RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers
There is only one number in the files
How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
